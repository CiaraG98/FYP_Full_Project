Scream 2 is fast moving and has amazing suspense scenes. Scream 3 has the movie set of Sydney’s old house which gives me chills just thinking about it. 1/2

1046913925936074752,2018-10-02 00:05:05,@RBlackCoyote i think maybe i just connected to it because as a youtube who is constantly being used for views the idea of a parent doing it hits me in a weird emotional place. but i very much said that she’s not a bad person and that later we see more of her story.
1046913609786306560,2018-10-02 00:03:49,@RBlackCoyote they..... post..... videos....... of....... them.....hating on each other.....for public consumption....... i feel like it’s important to show that. it says so much about jake and why he is who he is..... which was the point of the series. and a turning point for me personally

1045621357524873216,2018-09-28 10:28:52,@rachelstarlive @itshayleybop @ZacharyJRose @jessesaintjohn then you aren’t a sociopath. because sociopaths don’t care about their safety. at all. they have a disregard for themselves and others. it’s the main characteristic
1045619031120568321,2018-09-28 10:19:38,i understand why people are upset. i definetly went overboard with the horror movie editing but that’s cause i got excited &amp; love editing horror. but i’m going to be more sensitive with the editing going forward. the last thing i want it to hurt anyone. :(its never my intention. https://t.co/aNcXkJo5eI

1045598564703846403,2018-09-28 08:58:18,@jessesaintjohn because at the end of the day sociopaths are real and almost every single movie talks about them and there’s tons of articles online about it. all i did was put it on my channel and talk about something i’m interested in because i’ve been so hurt by them in the past.
1045598256221155329,2018-09-28 08:57:05,@jessesaintjohn in a world where we have a shooting daily and we have sexual assault all over it feels like telling people to be more vigilant isn’t a bad thing. even if it causes a few people to freak out and say “is my friend a sociopath?!” on twitter and forget 2 hours later. seems worth it.

1045593585314226176,2018-09-28 08:38:31,@jessesaintjohn why is it bad to help the average person spot the signs just to be aware. not to diagnose. but to at least be aware. i wish i knew about it sooner.
1045593172665987077,2018-09-28 08:36:53,@jessesaintjohn teaching people how to spot the obvious signs is helping them get away from a toxic relationship and could even save them from having children with someone who doesn’t actually care about them. or anyone
1045593019615830016,2018-09-28 08:36:16,@jessesaintjohn people with severe antisocial personality disorders don’t have empathy and don’t care. at all. so for anyone to be offended is so confusing to me considering they actually literally don’t care. like. at all. and its something that is rarely even discussed and it can affect lives.

1044877526009610242,2018-09-26 09:13:09,usually i post back to back but then i get sad when it’s over. i like the idea of spreading them out a little. since theres 8 parts i was thinking maybe 2 a week? they’re all around 40-50 min so that’s still a lot to watch. would it be more fun to make the series last longer?😬👁 https://t.co/sIrJzJW3CL
